# Image-Denoising
In this project, Image Denoising is considered for two cases. The first one is additive Gaussian noise while the second one is speckle 
noise. Our approach is based on wavelet transform (Donoho's approach). Also, both hard thresholding and soft thresholding are considered for 
the denoising purpose.
